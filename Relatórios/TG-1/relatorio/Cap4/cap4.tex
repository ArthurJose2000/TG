Next steps has been discussed with the advisor and the co-advisor, and the main points are:

\begin{itemize}
\item to compare the proposed algorithm with well-known algorithms in the context of maze-solving challenges;
\item to generalize the proposed algorithm to search algorithms in graphs;
\item to establish a mixed radix representation to the agent path.
\end{itemize}
