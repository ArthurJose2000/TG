Computational search algorithms have been studied by many scholars and engineering companies since the last century due to the real-life applications of such algorithms, such as in airline scheduling, planning path on maps, search engine algorithms, social media marketing, Internet routing protocols, robotics, etc. Usually these methods rely on abstract data types, including graphs and trees, to transfer a real-world problem into a delimited and more comprehensive environment. In the context of computer science, graphs are abstract data type that might support computational search algorithms. 

From the maze-solving algorithms approach, this work aims to propose a method to explore a graph in a multi-agent situation, where the agents cannot communicate with each other, that makes reference to real-life problems, like deep sea exploration, search in large wall structures, search with low energy-based agents in inhospitable environments.
